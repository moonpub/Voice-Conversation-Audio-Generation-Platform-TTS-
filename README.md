# 🎙️ ElevenLabs Clone – Self-Hosted AI Audio Studio

## 🚀 Overview

This is a full-stack, self-hosted clone of ElevenLabs — your all-in-one AI audio generation playground. 🔥 Instead of relying on external APIs, we host our own cutting-edge models for:

- **🔊 Text-to-Speech (TTS)** with **StyleTTS2**
- **🎭 Voice Conversion** with **Seed-VC**
- **🎵 Text-to-Audio** with **Make-An-Audio**

All models are fine-tuned for custom voices, containerized via Docker 🐳, and exposed through blazing-fast FastAPI endpoints ⚡. The frontend is powered by **Next.js** and the **T3 Stack**, offering a modern, responsive UI with voice selection, audio history, and full user management. Auth.js handles authentication, credits are managed dynamically, and Inngest keeps your AI infra from getting overwhelmed 🛡️.
